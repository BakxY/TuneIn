# Quality of Life Improvement Request

**Describe the Quality of Life Improvement**

A clear and concise description of the improvement you'd like to see. *(Be specific. Instead of "Make it better," say "Add persistent storage for the last used serial port settings.")*

**Motivation**

Why do you want this improvement? What problem does it solve or what benefit does it provide? *(Be specific. Instead of "It's annoying," say "Currently, I have to manually re-enter my serial port settings every time I launch TuneIn, which slows down my workflow and is repetitive.")*

**Suggested Implementation**

How could this improvement be implemented? Be as specific as possible. *(For example, "Implement a configuration file (e.g., TOML, YAML) that automatically saves the last successfully connected serial port and its settings upon application exit and loads them on startup.")*

**Possible Use Cases**

Provide examples of how this improvement would be used and who would benefit from it. *(For example, "This would benefit all regular users of TuneIn, especially those who work with the same MIDI synthesizer and serial adapter frequently. It would save time and provide a more seamless user experience.")*

**Screenshots/Mockups (Optional)**

If applicable, add screenshots or mockups to help visualize the improvement. *(Annotate screenshots or create mockups to clearly show the proposed changes.)*

**Additional context**

Add any other context about the improvement here. *(This is important! Include things like:)*

* Are there any similar features in other terminal applications or serial testing tools?
* Do you have any specific preferences or requirements for the implementation (e.g., cross-platform compatibility considerations)?
* Are there any potential drawbacks or limitations to consider?
* Any relevant configuration details or workflows.
