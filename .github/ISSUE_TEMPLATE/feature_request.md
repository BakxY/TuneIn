**Motivation**

Why do you want this feature? What problem does it solve or what benefit does it provide? *(Be specific. Instead of "It would be nice," say "This feature would allow users to test advanced MIDI device functionalities that rely on SysEx messages, expanding TuneIn's utility for complex synthesizer development.")*

**Suggested Implementation**

How could this feature be implemented? Be as specific as possible. *(For example, "Add a new sub-mode in Manual Mode to construct SysEx messages, allowing users to input hexadecimal byte sequences or load from a file.")*

**Possible Use Cases**

Provide examples of how this feature would be used and who would benefit from it. *(For example, "This feature would be used by MIDI device developers to configure device-specific settings or update firmware. It would help them perform comprehensive testing of their MIDI implementations.")*

**Screenshots/Mockups (Optional)**

If applicable, add screenshots or mockups to help visualize the feature. *(Annotate screenshots or create mockups to clearly show the proposed feature.)*

**Additional context**

Add any other context about the feature here. *(This is important! Include things like:)*

* Are there any similar features in other MIDI testing tools?
* Do you have any specific preferences or requirements for the implementation (e.g., how the UI should look for this feature)?
* Are there any potential drawbacks or limitations to consider?
* Any relevant configuration details or workflows.
